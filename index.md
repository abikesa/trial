# Transcribed Steps

### 1. Run the following remote script

```stata
//created by watching the video 
do "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vince-Jin/Prompt/main/navigation.do"
```

### 2. Prompt-based vs. Syntax-based programming

``` 
Thank you so much for participating in the piloting program for prompt based programming approach!
 
In this program, we will run  programs to complete certain ...

```

Think of this as a trial of "Prompt-based" programming (novel approach being tested) vs. "Syntax-based" programming (the standard approach we teach at Hopkins)

### 3. Key outcome measure is "Time-to-completion"

Since the outcome measure is time, we can't predict how long it will take you to complete the "Prompt-based" approach or the "Syntax-based" approach. But the tasks aren't complex. Kindly be patient and follow the prompts, will include hints when the program recognizes that you're having a little trouble

### 4. Data collection

Once you've completed the trial program (prompt-based) as well as the control program (syntax-based), you get a prompt that looks like so:

```
Now you completed this pilot program!
Generating the log file for running time: 
Running time for Pilot Programs: 
Prompt Based (Q1): 71.10599999999999
Traditional (Q2): 260.37
```

### 5. Thank you for helping future Stata students!

We appreciate the time you've put aside to complete this survey. Each year helps the next to have a better experience. So we thank you on behalf of all the future students of this course!
